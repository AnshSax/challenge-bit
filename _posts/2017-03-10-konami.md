This is the first of the puzzle:bits, and the only one not created by the students. It's more of an example puzzle really, not that hard to solve if you know what the Konami code is :)

When it loads the puzzle will tell you that it's ready by displaying an "R" on the screen. To start solving press A and B together and the screen will tell you that it's waiting for you by showing a "G" (for Go!) on the screen.

As you successfully complete sections of the puzzle the screen will fill up. When you've completed the whole puzzle it will show "Y" on the screen.

If you make a mistake then you'll see an "N" on the screen and you'll have to press A and B together again to restart the puzzle from the beginning.

Good luck!

## Diary

This puzzle was made in haste, in order to fill the website/repo with just a little bit of content. It's probably not very good :(
